Handy C++ code that you always need when writing tests, learning stuff, teaching stuff...
The project gathers all the code that I write to help with the numerous little programs I myself develop or make other people (such as students) develop. The focus of the software modules gathered here is to get frequently needed, easy-to-use, expressive C++ for which I have found no suitable stuff elsewhere. The code is also supposed to have didactic qualities (mainly intended for students), as examples of best practice, patterns, genericity and other such desirable coding issues.

All source code is located in "src" folder and included in the "handy" namespace to reduce risk of collision with others. There is no corresponding "handy" folder but any other sub-namespace of "handy" will correspond to a sub-folder of "src".

Presently, the handy software modules are:
